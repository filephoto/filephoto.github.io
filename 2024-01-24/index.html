<h2 id="hello-world">hello, world</h2>
<p>welcome to the file.photo blog</p>
<p>our goal is to build the best raw photo archival site for photographers of all levels of experience levels</p>
<p>we think backups are important and saving every photo you ever take should be affordable</p>
<h3 id="why-raw">why raw?</h3>
<p>raw photos are the closest thing digital cameras can get to a film negative</p>
<p>any JPG, PNG, GIF, or other image you generate from your raw files can always be rerendered or recreated as long as the raw still exists</p>
<p>if you could archive every shot you ever took on your camera could:</p>
<ul>
<li>rerender images in the future with better photography software</li>
<li>track your progress as a photographer by comparing old shots with new ones</li>
<li>look back and find images that take on new meaning later in life</li>
<li>pass down photos that might be interesting to family or publications in the future</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="archival-options">archival options</h3>
<p>some folks save only the pictures they want</p>
<p>some folks build or buy NAS (network attached storage) devices</p>
<p>some folks use dropbox, apple, google, and other cloud storage providers</p>
<p>and some folks mix those options together</p>
<h3 id="cost">cost</h3>
<p>cloud providers are providing storage at cheaper and cheaper rates, which is great for us as archivists</p>
<p>on more consumer oriented products, we don't see discounted rates on storage until we're very high into the storage tiers (e.g. google's 4TB tier)</p>
<p>ideally we could start out small and pay as we go</p>
<h3 id="performance">performance</h3>
<p>local copies of raw files are important for being able to quickly work on post-processing</p>
<p>in a perfect world an archive could be just as fast local file access on our laptop</p>
<p>no cloud provider can quite give you that as they can't guarantee your internet connection speed</p>
<p>to achieve that you really need a NAS or some sort of large local storage</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if you love the NAS idea, we recommend <a href="https://blog.file.photo/2024-01-24/truenas.com">truenas</a> with offsite backups to <a href="https://blog.file.photo/2024-01-24/backblaze.com">backblaze</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="safety">safety</h3>
<p>we think the safest backup strategy is a local duplicate (or two) and uploading to a cloud provider that stores multiple copies</p>
<p>the sooner you get multiple copies of your raw photos, the less likely any device can be corrupted and lose them</p>
<p>SD cards fail, hard drives die, servers suffer power issues, and laptops burn out</p>
<p>that doesn't mean you should panic between when you're taking photos and when they're uploaded</p>
<p>it does mean that prioritizing some sort of offsite backup is good if you want to build an archive</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">conclusion</h3>
<p>if you are like us and love the idea of building an archive of your work over time at a fair price please stay tuned</p>
<p>we are working on a project that we hope will be simple to use, fast, reliable, and friendly to the frugal</p>
